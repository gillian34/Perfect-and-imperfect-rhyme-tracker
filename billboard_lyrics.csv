you can always go - downtown.
when you've got worries all the noise and the hurry

just listen to the music of the traffic in the city
linger on the sidewalk where the neon signs are pretty
how can you lose?

the lights are much brighter there
you can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares
so go downtown
things will be great when you're downtown
no finer place for sure downtown
everything's waiting for you.

don't hang around and let your problems surround you
there are movie shows downtown.
maybe you know some little places to go to
where they never close downtown.

just listen to the rhythm of a gentle bossa nova

you'll be dancing with 'em too before the night is over

happy again.
the lights are much brighter there
you can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares
so go - downtown
where all the lights are bright downtown
waiting for you tonight downtown
you're gonna be alright now
downtown
downtown

downtown
and you may find somebody kind to help and understand you
someone who is just like you and needs a gentle hand to

guide them along.
so maybe i'll see you there
we can forget all our troubles, forget all our cares
so go downtown

",1965,"no one will understand what i've gotta do
i've gotta find a place to hide with my baby by my side
she's been hurt so much, they treat her mean and cruel
they try to keep us far apart, there's only one thing left we can do

we gotta keep searchin', searchin', find a place to hide
searchin', searchin', she'll be by my side
if we gotta keep on the run, we'll follow the sun-ah, whee-ooh
follow the sun-ah, whee-ooh

doesn't matter, doesn't matter what people might say
she's mine, and i'm gonna take her anyway

gotta keep searchin', searchin', find a place to stay
searchin', searchin', every night and day
if we gotta keep on the run, we'll follow the sun-ah, whee-ooh
follow the sun-ah, whee-ooh

we gotta keep searchin', searchin', find a place to hide
searchin', searchin', she'll be by my side
if we gotta keep on the run, we'll follow the sun-ah, whee-ooh
follow the sun-ah, whee-ooh
follow the sun-ah, whee-ooh
follow the sun",0
100,how sweet it is (to be loved by you),"marvin gaye
",1965,"how sweet it is to be loved by you, yes, baby
how sweet it is to be loved by you

ooh, baby, i needed the shelter of someone's arms
and there you were
i needed someone to understand my ups and downs
and there you were

with sweet love and devotion
deeply touching my emotion
i want to stop and thank you, baby
i want to stop and thank you, baby

hey now, how sweet it is to be loved by you
oh baby, how sweet it is to be loved by you, yes, it is

close my eyes at night
and wonder what would i be without you in my life
everything was just a bore
all the things i did seems i've done 'em before

but you brightened up all my days
with a love so sweet in so many ways
i want to stop and thank you, baby
i want to stop and thank you, baby

hey, how sweet it is to be loved by you, oh yes it is, baby
how sweet it is to be loved by you, yes it is, baby

you were better to me than i've been to myself
for me, there's you and  nobody else
stop and thank you, baby
i want to stop and thank you, baby

oh, how sweet it is to be loved by you, tell the truth, baby
how sweet it is to be loved by you
well, it's like sugar to my soul

how sweet it is to be loved by you, oh yes it is, baby",0
